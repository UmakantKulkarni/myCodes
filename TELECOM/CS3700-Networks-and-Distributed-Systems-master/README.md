CS3700 Networks and Distributed Systems 

Course Description:

Introduces the fundamentals of computer networks, including network architectures, network topologies, network protocols, layering concepts (for example, ISO/OSI, TCP/IP reference models), communication paradigms (point-to-point vs. multicast/broadcast, connectionless vs. connection oriented), and networking APIs (sockets). Also covers the construction of distributed programs, with an emphasis on high-level protocols and distributed state sharing. Topics include design patterns, transactions, performance trade-offs, security implications, and reliability. Uses examples from real networks (TCP/IP, Ethernet, 802.11) and distributed systems (Web, BitTorrent, DNS) to reinforce concepts.

Included Projects:
- Simulated Routing Bridges
- TCP-like transport protocol implementation
- Web Crawler
- Distributed Key Value Storgae based on RAFT protocol

Course Grade: A
