##Coursera SDN Virtual Machine Setup

###Setting up the course VM

####Prerequisite

To get started install these softwares on your host machine:

1. Install ***Vagrant***, it is a wrapper around virtualization softwares like VirtualBox, VMWare etc.: http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads

2. Install ***VirtualBox***, this would be your VM provider: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

3. Install ***Git***, it is a distributed version control system: https://git-scm.com/downloads

4. Install X Server and SSH capable terminal
    * For Windows install [Xming](http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=156984&filename=Xming-6-9-0-31-setup.exe) and [Putty](http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe).
    * For MAC OS install [XQuartz](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki) and Terminal.app (builtin)
    * Linux comes pre-installed with X server and Gnome terminal + SSH (buitlin)   

####Basics

* Clone the course repository from Github:
```bash 
$ git clone https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/Coursera-SDN
```

* Change the directory to Coursera-SDN:
```bash
$ cd Coursera-SDN
```

* Now run the vagrant up command. This will read the Vagrantfile from the current directory and provision the VM accordingly:
```bash
$ vagrant up
```

If you want to tear down your vagrant session, you have multiple options to do so, each has its pros and cons. These options are as follows: 
* **vagrant suspend**: With this option you will be able to save the state of the VM and stop it. 
* **vagrant halt**: This will gracefully shutdown the guest operating system and power down the guest machine. 
* **vagrant destroy**: If you want to remove all traces of the guest machine from your system, this is the command you should use. It will power down the machine and remove all guest hard disks

Go [here](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/teardown.html) for more information about vagrant teardown. 

**Note**: By default it will instantiate a 64 bit VM. In case you want to run a 32 bit VM, you will need to change the ```config.vm.box_url``` parameter in the Vagrantfile as shown below: 
```
## 64 bit Vagrant Box
#config.vm.box_url = "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/sdn1/srcs/Vagrant%20Box/coursera-sdn-2015_64bit.box"

## 32 bit Vagrant Box 
config.vm.box_url = "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/sdn1/srcs/Vagrant%20Box/coursera-sdn-2015_32bit.box"
```

* Now SSH into the VM:
``` bash
$ vagrant ssh
```



* Programming assignments: You will find the programming assignments in the vm under the directory: /vagrant/assignments.
``` bash
vagrant@coursera-sdn:~$ ls /vagrant/
assignments  README.md  setup  Vagrantfile
```

* To perform a simple test to check if your VM setup is correct, run the command:
```bash
sudo mn
```
This will start a Mininet bash terminal. Type ```xterm h1 h2``` in this terminal. If two external terminals pop out, then your setup worked as expected. 

#### Notes and Tips for running vagrant and the course VM
- Follow the instructions closely
- If you are running a 64bit OS, run a 64 bit VM
- If you are running a 32bit OS, run a 32 bit VM
- Disable Hyper-V on Windows
- Enable Virtualization support on the host (BIOS setup)
- The VM runs 192.168.0.0/24 as default network, if you use that network locally you need to change it (edit Vagrantfile: config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.0.100”)
- The host machine needs to run an X server (it’s native on Linux; OS X and Windowns require the installation of an X Server)
- Alternative methods to ssh to the VM: run "ssh -X vagrant@192.168.0.100" password is vagrant
- If you see "ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer" when trying to connect using "vagrant ssh" use the alternative method provided above since it has been reported as a valid workaround, this issue is under investigation
- The shared folder: "Coursera-SDN" git cloned folder for the host and /vagrant for the guest
- Some students reported that on old/slower machines some assignments might fail because of extra delay on the computation wich translates to increaced delay on ping request/response. The original default vagrant configuration for VBox was 2Gb RAM and 1 CPU with 50% cap. We changed this to 1GB RAM and 1 CPU with no cap. We think this new configuration will be good for most, but if you want to you can always tweek this to your requirements or likings (edit the line that starts with "# CPU & RAM" on Vagrantfile)

#### Sample setup output for reference
- Following output is from MacOS

========================================

exit   iperf  net       pingallfull  px            source  xterm 

You may also send a command to a node using:
  <node> command {args}
For example:
  mininet> h1 ifconfig

The interpreter automatically substitutes IP addresses
for node names when a node is the first arg, so commands
like
  mininet> h2 ping h3
should work.

Some character-oriented interactive commands require
noecho:
  mininet> noecho h2 vi foo.py
However, starting up an xterm/gterm is generally better:
  mininet> xterm h2

mininet> h1 ifconfig
