## Bootstrapping Basics

If you want to bootstrap Maven, you'll need:

- Java 1.7+
- Ant 1.8 or later

Run Ant, specifying a location into which the completed Maven distro should be installed:

```
ant -Dmaven.home="$HOME/apps/maven/apache-maven-3.3.x-SNAPSHOT"
```

Once the build completes, you should have a new Maven distro ready to roll in that directory!
